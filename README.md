A simple NodeJS script for cloning an existing Typescript project and create a new Javascipt project.

## Usage:

`node index.js /absolute/path/of/typescipt/project/ /absolute/path/of/javascript/project/`

### Example:

`node index.js ~/Projects/DemoTS ~/Projects/DemoJS`

`DemoTS` directly needs to exists, but `DemoJS` directly in not required to exist and will be created if it doesn't exist.
